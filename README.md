# Django REST framework

This is a fork of django-rest-framework v2.4.x, just renamed to
`rest_framework2` so it can installed alongside rest_framework to ease the
porting from 2.4.x to 3.x.

1. `pip install djangorestframework2`
2. find and replace all imports of `rest_framework` with `rest_framework2`
3. `pip install djangorestframework`
4. Start porting your code view by view.
